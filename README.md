# nbstyle

UI styles for Jupyter notebooks. I'm currently working on `Darkglow`, a dark mode theme for tree views.

To add the `Darkglow` theme (**warning**: this will replace `custom.css`), run:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ericeasthope/nbstyle.git
```

Then, refresh your browser to load the theme.

Please consider [supporting](https://www.ericeasthope.me/support) this work. Doing so helps me know what people want and where to allocate my time. Thank you!
